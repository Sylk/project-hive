# Project Hive

*Project Hive* is a large-scale patch for the 2004 GameCube game *Custom Robo: Battle Revolution*. *Project Hive* is built on the amazing [Parts Expansion](https://github.com/DesiacX/CRBR-Parts-Expansion) build by DesiacX and includes balance changes to nearly every part, new parts pulled from other *CR* games, new parts created *a priori*, and various quality-of-life codes to improve the competitive experience.

The balance changes for *Project Hive* were originally done by beesbutinabox, and *Project Hive* is currently maintained by members of the [Custom Robo community discord](https://discord.gg/qPXvwdeT3V).
